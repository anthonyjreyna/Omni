        answer: {
            ans:"We aim to have every campaign live within 5-7 business days of the kickoff meeting. On average, you should start seeing warm leads (aka qualified connections) hit your inbox within the first 2 weeks. Once the warm leads start rolling in, we're focused on optimizing for the highest number of warm leads possible while simultaneously working closely with you to develop a conversation strategy to get the maximum number of warm leads to reply and engage you in 2-way conversations. While our goal is to get you qualified leads and meetings in month 1, in competitive industries with long, complex sales cycles and high average contract values, it can take longer.",

        answer: {
            ans:"Cold email is a powerful tactic to propose a business partnership. Unfortunately many do not know how to use it properly. We are used to being mass emailed from overseas companies that hold no relevancy. We do not do that.We research your industry, understand your value proposition and communicate that to your ideal prospect.",

We only email business email addresses, place an opt-out link on all communication, do not email people who have opted out previously and always ensure your messaging is relevant with a business/professional reason for the outreach.",

        answer: {
            ans:"After our initial meeting and project agreement, you’ll fill out an onboarding form. Once completed, we’ll get to work on collecting data of your ideal prospects so we can start preparing outbound copy. We then start the domain warming process which takes 14 days and on the 15th day, we initiate campaign launch. In the meantime, we are sending 100+ outbound messages per day via LinkedIn to generate responses while your domains are warming up. Totally unreasonable not to generate tons of positive responses with prospects interested in your offer.",
